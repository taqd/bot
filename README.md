# A crypto/asset trading bot

This is all pre-alpha, in development and a mere first pass at a general framework for reading from, reacting to and judging its own prediction accuracy from a data stream.

For me, this was a way to remember C++ from several years away, and I put off development when I remembered enough to study the language directly. I have yet to return to this bot to improve it with my now significantly improvement in programming ability.

To follow execution: start at the "bot" script, then follow exection through subdirectories in numerical order.
